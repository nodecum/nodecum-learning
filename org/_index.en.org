It is our goal to develop a self-sufficient communication system
based on open source software.
We want the [[https://zephyrproject.org/][Zephyr]] RTOS (Real Time Operating System)
to be used. The hardware related programming can be a challenge
for the beginner.
We want to find together a way to understand the programming and
hardware development step by step and example.
