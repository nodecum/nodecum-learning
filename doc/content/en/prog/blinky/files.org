* CMakeLists.txt
#+include: "progdir/CMakeLists.txt" src cmake 
This file contains the information where to find the sources of the project.
We have only one source file ~src/main.c~
which is listed in src_cmake{target_sources(app PRIVATE src/main.c)}.
* prj.conf
#+include: "progdir/prj.conf" src config
The project configuration file tells which components of the kernel are needed.
Here we need the ~GPIO~ - General Purpose In/Out Subsystem.
